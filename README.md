Electronic Structure Project -Room temperature superconductors of H3S at high pressure within the BCS theory.
This is a report for a project I did during my MSc using Quantum Espresso to run simulations to investigate 
superconducting materials leveraging the power of the Cirrus powered EPSRC Tier-2 National HPC .
